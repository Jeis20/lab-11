Marketing Research Team
As a market researcher, I want to gauge user's interest in a specific set of products to determine top performers.
As a market researcher, I need products displayed in multiples of 3 and give users 25 selections maximum.
As a market researcher, I need to know the # of times products are displayed and breakdown of click-rates.

Developers
As a developer, I want to create an app that allows users to view and select products shown in multiples of 3.
As a developer, I need to create functionality to enable products (images) shown to be counted and % of clicks to be calculated and later displayed once the user has used their 25 selections.
As a developer, I need to ensure that images are not repeated in the display for two consecutive selections by the user.

Focus Group Participants
As a user, I want clear direction on the purpose of the app and how my role can help.
As a user, I want a great user experience with nice aesthetics, but also keep things simple.
As a user, I want obvious navigation and the ability to complete the survey with ease.
